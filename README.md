# GitHub labels

A list of GitHub labels for reuse across projects.

You can use the [`github-labels` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-labels) to import the labels to your project.

If the project requires it, it is advisable to add some source tags: `source: sourceName`.

## Demo

You can find a demo [here in this same repository](https://github.com/abdonrd/github-labels/labels).
